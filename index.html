                        Hello! My name is Tommy Le. I absolutely love to play video games and hang out with good friends. As well as listen to different
                        kinds of music. My current games that I am playing are Final Fantasy XIV Online, Overwatch, and Monster
                        Hunter World on the PS4. I like all kinds of gaming genres, from roleplaying games to first person
                        shooters. I also like sports car and currently own a 10th generation 2007 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution
                        MR edition. One day, I hope to get myself a Nissan GTR. :) Adding more text to fill up this row.

                        that's what it's gonna make, bacon pancaaake!

                        I was born here in Dallas, TX along with my two other brothers. My parents were born in Vietnam. My mother is from the city
                        of Đà Nẵng and my father is from the city of Bến Tre. I received my very first computer in the form
                        of a Pentium 1 Packard Bell at the age of 12 and that lead the way for my love of computers and technology.
                        I also learned how to make my parents angry back when America Online (AOL) used to charge by the
                        hour instead of unlimited usage. ;) I was able to disassemble and reassemble computers by the age
                        of 15 and was already familiar with the internet at an early age. I attended the University of Texas
                        at Dallas back in 2001. I graduated 5 years later with two bachelors of sciences in Computer Science
                        and Software Engineering.
